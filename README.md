# Spine-Biopsy-Project
# Project Name: Antibiotic Protocol Analysis

## Description
The Antibiotic Protocol Analysis project involved collaborating with a primary radiologist to perform cohort analysis, aiming to optimize the allocation of hospital resources. Through the analysis, it was discovered that 70 percent of patient biopsies did not impact their antibiotic protocol, leading to improved resource management.

To conduct the analysis, a Python script was developed, utilizing SQLite to query data from hundreds of patients at Loyola. The data was then analyzed to identify patient comorbidities that correlated with a higher likelihood of antibiotic protocol changes.

To effectively communicate the findings to the radiologist, various charts and graphs were created using matplotlib. These visualizations provided a clear and concise representation of the analysis results.
